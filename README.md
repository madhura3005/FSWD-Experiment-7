**#Conclusion:**

In this experiment, we successfully established a connection between a Node.js application and a MongoDB database using the official MongoDB Node.js driver. We learned how to perform essential CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete — on a MongoDB collection through both backend logic and HTTP routes. This hands-on implementation demonstrated how MongoDB's flexibility and Express.js's simplicity can be combined to build efficient, real-time, and scalable web applications. Overall, the experiment provided a solid foundation for using NoSQL databases in modern web development environments.
